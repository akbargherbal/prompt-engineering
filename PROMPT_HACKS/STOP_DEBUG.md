Stop. Before suggesting another solution, let's follow a structured debugging approach:

**Current Error/Context:** 
```

```


**Required Analysis:**
1. **Failure Reflection:** Explicitly explain why the last attempted solution failed, referencing both what was tried and what actually happened.

2. **Multiple Hypothesis Generation:** Formulate 2-3 distinct hypotheses about the root cause (e.g., "Hypothesis A: Version compatibility issue. Hypothesis B: Missing dependency. Hypothesis C: Environment configuration problem").

3. **Diagnostic Steps:** For each hypothesis, propose one specific, minimal diagnostic command or check I can run to confirm or refute it. Focus on gathering evidence, not trying more solutions.

4. **Evidence-Based Next Steps:** Only after I provide the diagnostic results, propose the next action based on what the evidence actually shows.

Do not suggest any fixes or workarounds until we complete this diagnostic process. The goal is to identify the actual problem before attempting more solutions.
