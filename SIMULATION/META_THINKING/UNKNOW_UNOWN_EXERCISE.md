> ### Lesson 2: The Johari Window & Unknown Unknowns
>
> **Concept** →
> The _Johari Window_ is a simple psychological model to describe knowledge about ourselves and situations. It has four quadrants:
>
> 1. **Known knowns** — Things _you know you know_.
> 2. **Known unknowns** — Things _you know you don’t know_.
> 3. **Unknown knowns** — Things _you know unconsciously but don’t realize_.
> 4. **Unknown unknowns** — Things _you don’t even realize you don’t know_.

This last quadrant is where surprises, risks, and opportunities live. Donald Rumsfeld made this famous in 2002 when he said:

> _“…there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”_

In decision-making, projects, and even self-awareness, the danger of “unknown unknowns” is that you can’t plan for them directly — but you _can_ improve how you uncover them over time by asking better questions, seeking diverse viewpoints, and experimenting.

The Johari Window is often drawn as a 2×2 grid, and it’s a helpful way to think about learning and discovery.

> **Practice** →
> Draw a quick 2×2 table on paper or in text, and fill it out for yourself with an example of something you’re working on or thinking about.

- Top-left: Known knowns
- Top-right: Known unknowns
- Bottom-left: Unknown knowns
- Bottom-right: Unknown unknowns (just describe what you suspect might be there)

Write it here when ready.

> **Stretch Goal** →
> After your table, write a 2–3 sentence reflection on _how you might reduce the size of your “unknown unknowns”_.
