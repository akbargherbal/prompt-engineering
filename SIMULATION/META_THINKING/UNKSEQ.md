# The Power of *Unknown Unknowns* (UNK²) for Developers

One of the most valuable exercises for any developer is learning to navigate the *unknown unknowns* — let’s call them **UNK²** — when turning an idea into a prototype.

Every developer has experienced it: you’re relaxing one day, maybe listening to some nostalgic music, or out on your afternoon walk with noise-canceling headphones, lost in a favorite track. Suddenly, inspiration strikes — *“I wish there was an app that could do this thing with music!”* The thought lingers, and you tell yourself, *“Maybe I should build it.”*

But then reality sets in. Sure, you know how to program — but you realize you know almost nothing about music itself. Beyond recognizing the names of instruments, you don’t really understand how music is structured or produced. That’s when it’s time to pause and reflect.

This is the essence of working with UNK². It’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of a new idea and start building without fully understanding the domain. But without that domain knowledge, you risk reinventing the wheel — or worse, creating something no one needs because a better solution already exists.

Instead, use that spark of passion as a starting point. Be curious, but cautious. Talk to professionals in the field, learn how things are done today, and explore whether your idea truly fills a gap. By embracing the unknowns — and actively seeking to turn them into knowns — you not only grow as a developer, but also increase your chances of creating something genuinely valuable.

In short: don’t let the unknown unknowns paralyze you, but don’t ignore them either. They’re not roadblocks — they’re signposts pointing you to what you need to learn next.

## An Exercise to Uncover Your UNK²

To help you get better at spotting your blind spots, here’s a simple, tried-and-true exercise you can do right now. It only takes a few minutes, and all you need is a piece of paper and a pen.

We’ll use a tool called the **Johari Window**, a 2×2 grid that helps you map what you know, what you don’t know, and what you haven’t even realized you don’t know yet.

### Step 1: Draw the Grid

On your paper, sketch a 2×2 table like this:

```
+-------------------+-------------------+
| Known Knowns      | Known Unknowns   |
| (things you know  | (things you know |
| you know)         | you don’t know) |
+-------------------+-------------------+
| Unknown Knowns    | Unknown Unknowns |
| (things you know  | (things you don’t|
| unconsciously)    | even realize you|
|                   | don’t know)      |
+-------------------+-------------------+
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Idea

Pick one idea you’ve been thinking about — perhaps that music app idea, or any other project that’s been on your mind. Write the name of the idea at the top of the page.

### Step 3: Fill It In

Now, spend a few minutes filling in each box:

* **Known Knowns** — What do you already know about this domain, your skills, and the problem you want to solve?
* **Known Unknowns** — What gaps are you already aware of? What questions do you know you’ll need to answer?
* **Unknown Knowns** — Are there skills or insights you already have but might not be connecting to this idea yet?
* **Unknown Unknowns** — What are your hunches about what you don’t even know yet? What hidden risks, assumptions, or surprises might lurk?

It doesn’t have to be perfect — just jot down whatever comes to mind.

### Step 4: Reflect

Finally, write 2–3 sentences below the table answering this question:

> *How can I reduce my unknown unknowns?*

For example: *“I could talk to a musician to learn how they actually work with audio. I could research existing apps and see what they already do. I could build a quick prototype and get feedback.”*

That reflection is where the magic happens — it turns blind spots into opportunities to grow.

Doing this kind of exercise regularly will make you a more thoughtful, effective developer. You’ll get better at spotting risks and better at finding the real value in your ideas.

For now, grab that pen and paper and try it the old-fashioned way — and keep an eye out. Soon enough, we might just have an app to help you through it.
