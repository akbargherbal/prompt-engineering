Great instincts — all of the names you suggested fit the spirit of the idea: playful, a little mysterious, and tied to *unknown unknowns*.

Here are some more suggestions in the same vein, to help you brainstorm:

✅ **Short & Catchy Variants**

* **UNK²** — Clean, mathematical, and close to what you already use.
* **unkseq** — (like “unknown sequence”) clever and sounds technical.
* **unkunk** — Quirky and memorable.
* **Unknown²** — A more readable form of UNK².
* **UnkSquared** — Spelled out but still compact.
* **2UNK** — A flipped, minimal version.

✅ **Slightly Descriptive or Evocative**

* **Blindspot** — Focuses on what you don’t see yet.
* **Fog of Dev** — Alluding to the “fog of war,” but for developers and unknowns.
* **Hidden Grid** — A nod to the Johari Window as a grid.
* **Beyond Known** — Poetic, and clear.
* **Dark Corners** — Where the unknowns live.

✅ **Playful & Fun**

* **Oops! App** — Lighthearted take on what we miss.
* **??²** — Emoji-inspired shorthand for “double unknown.”
* **Unknowable** — Slightly philosophical.
* **What’s This?** — Curious tone.

✅ **Professional Tone (if you want to appeal to teams)**

* **Discovery²** — About structured exploration.
* **Clarity Grid** — Focuses on the *outcome* of the exercise.
* **InsightMap** — Clear and business-friendly.

If you tell me a bit about your target audience (just yourself? indie devs? big teams?) and the vibe you want (serious? playful? technical?), I can refine the list and even help you check domain availability and branding ideas.

Want me to shortlist just 3–5 top picks that fit a particular tone?
