# SimulationCraft Pro - Project Intake Form

## Problem Statement
**What specific technical decision or architectural challenge do you need to evaluate?**

[Describe the system you're building and what decisions you need help with. Be specific about the problem domain and the types of solutions you want to compare.]

---

## Context

### Background Knowledge
I've read the "LLM-Based Solution Architecture Simulator" report and understand:
- Multi-agent orchestration using CrewAI/LangGraph/AutoGen
- Structured solution generation techniques (Pattern Prompting, Morphological Analysis)
- Cost optimization through LLM cascading
- Developer profile-based evaluation

### My Technical Environment
**Programming Experience**: 6 years Python development
**Development Setup**: [VSCode/PyCharm/Other - fill in your preferred IDE and workflow]
**Current Project Stack**: [List your existing tech stack, frameworks, or constraints]
**LLM Experience Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced with LLM APIs]

---

## Constraints

### Budget Constraints
**Available Budget**: [e.g., "$100 total", "$25/month", "as minimal as possible"]
**Cost Priority**: [High/Medium/Low - how important is minimizing API costs?]

### Timeline Constraints  
**Target Completion**: [e.g., "1 week", "end of month", "2 weeks", "flexible"]
**Urgency Level**: [High/Medium/Low - do you need this ASAP or can development be gradual?]

### Success Criteria
**Primary Goal**: [Choose one: "Maximum solution diversity", "Lowest implementation cost", "Easiest to maintain long-term", "Fastest initial setup", "Most accurate evaluations"]

**Must-Have Features**: [List 2-3 essential requirements for your simulation]

**Nice-to-Have Features**: [List 1-2 features that would be valuable but not critical]

## Request

Based on this information, please:
1. Conduct your strategic assessment with targeted follow-up questions
2. Recommend the optimal architecture approach for my constraints  
3. Provide a concrete implementation plan with code templates
4. Include cost estimates and optimization strategies

I'm ready to start coding today and need an actionable blueprint I can follow step-by-step.
