# Problem Statement
PROBLEM_STATEMENT = """
Create a solution that makes Gemini CLI more usable by eliminating its poor UI/UX. 
The solution must:
- Watch for saves to 'prompt.md' in a chosen repository
- Automatically send content to Gemini CLI running in background
- Append responses to 'TUTORIALS/output.md' in pure Markdown
- Work seamlessly with VSCode in a dual-monitor setup
- Require minimal terminal interaction after setup
- Run on Windows/WSL environment
- Be easy to deploy and maintain (max 5min predictable weekly maintenance)

The goal is a 'set it and forget it' automation that bridges the gap between 
VSCode's comfortable editing environment and Gemini CLI's powerful capabilities.
