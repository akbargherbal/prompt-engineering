Based on the product requirements document, here are the features ranked by criticality:

## MUST HAVE FEATURES (Critical)

**1. File watching with immediate response to saves**

- Bridge detects when `prompt.md` is saved and triggers Gemini CLI automatically
- This is the core automation that enables the hands-off workflow

**2. Repository-based file structure**

- Both `prompt.md` and `TUTORIALS/output.md` must live inside the same chosen repository
- Gemini CLI runs in the background within this repository context
- Essential for maintaining project context and organization

**3. Pure Markdown output formatting**

- All responses **appended** to `TUTORIALS/output.md` in clean Markdown format
- Absolutely no HTML formatting in output files
- Critical for readability and VSCode compatibility

**4. Response appending to output file**

- All Gemini responses **append** to `TUTORIALS/output.md`
- Maintains conversation history without overwriting previous responses

**5. Background Gemini CLI execution**

- Gemini CLI runs silently in background within the chosen repository
- No visible terminal interaction required during normal operation

**6. Minimal terminal interaction after setup**

- Zero-to-minimum terminal use once the bridge is running
- Critical for reducing eye strain and context switching

## MUST HAVE FEATURES (Important)

**7. Safety validations**

- Prevent accidental execution in system directories
- Basic validation that target directory is actually a code repository
- Protects against potentially harmful operations

**8. VSCode integration compatibility**

- Files must be readable and editable in VSCode
- Output should work well with VSCode's Markdown preview
- Ensures smooth workflow within the primary development environment

## SHOULD HAVE FEATURES (Implied Requirements)

**9. Repository selection during setup**

- Ability to choose which repository to monitor during initial configuration
- Enables project-specific usage

**10. Reliable file system monitoring**

- Robust file watching that doesn't miss saves or create duplicate triggers
- Ensures consistent automation behavior

**11. Error handling and recovery**

- Graceful handling of Gemini CLI failures or network issues
- Maintains system stability during edge cases

The top 6 features are absolutely critical for the basic workflow to function, while features 7-8 are essential for safety and usability. The remaining features are important for a complete, production-ready solution.
