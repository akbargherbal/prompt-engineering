# Gemini CLI Bridge Architecture Simulator

## üéØ Why This Project Exists

### The Original Problem
After PRK surgery, I needed to reduce eye strain while coding but still leverage Google's Gemini CLI as an agentic code mentor. The terminal interface was creating too much context switching and strain. I wanted to work entirely within VSCode - writing prompts in one file, getting responses in another - both in a comfortable, readable format.

### The Meta-Problem
Instead of immediately building a solution, I decided to **simulate different architectural approaches** to find the optimal path. This project applies LLM-based simulation techniques to real-world technical decision-making.

## üß† The Simulation Strategy

### Why Multi-Agent Architecture?
Single LLM queries tend to produce 1-2 obvious solutions. A multi-agent system with specialized roles generates diverse options and systematic evaluation:

- **SolutionArchitect**: Creative generation of 10-12 diverse approaches
- **TechnicalCritic**: Brutal analysis of maintenance overhead and failure modes  
- **ProfileAlignment**: Scoring against my specific developer preferences

### Why CrewAI Over Alternatives?
- **LangGraph**: Too complex for a 2-3 day timeline
- **AutoGen**: Conversational approach too token-expensive
- **CrewAI**: Sequential process, role-based paradigm, perfect for structured evaluation

## üí∞ Economic Design Decisions

### Budget Constraint: $30 for simulation
- **Target**: 10-12 solutions fully evaluated for under $5
- **Strategy**: Gemini 2.0 cascade (Pro for reasoning, Flash for scoring)
- **Token Optimization**: Structured outputs, minimal context passing

### Cost vs Insight Trade-off
- More agents = more diverse perspectives BUT higher cost
- Chose 3 specialized agents as optimal balance
- Enhanced data capture adds zero API cost (pure logging)

| Framework | Complexity | Speed | Cost | Fit for Solo Dev |
|-----------|------------|-------|------|------------------|
| CrewAI    | Low        | High  | Low  | ‚úÖ Perfect       |

### Agent Role Design
**SolutionArchitect (Gemini Pro):**
- Temperature: 0.7 (creative but focused)
- Task: Generate diverse architectural patterns
- Backstory: Pragmatic architect who thinks beyond obvious solutions

**TechnicalCritic (Gemini Pro):**
- Temperature: 0.7 (detailed reasoning needed)
- Task: Identify maintenance nightmares and deployment complexity
- Backstory: Battle-tested senior dev who's seen clever solutions fail

**ProfileAlignment (Gemini Flash):**
- Temperature: 0.3 (consistent scoring)
- Task: Score against quantified developer profile
- Backstory: Embodies my specific technical preferences

### Developer Profile Quantification
```json
{
  "language:python": 1.0,        // Strong preference
  "language:javascript": -0.6,   // Functional but reluctant
  "maintenance:predictable_5min": 0.8,  // Acceptable
  "maintenance:unpredictable_1hour": -1.0,  // Deal-breaker
  "deployment:one_click": 1.0,   // Strongly preferred
  "ui:terminal_based": -0.9      // Major friction point
}
```

## üîç Enhanced Data Capture Rationale

### Why Four Output Files?
1. **results.md**: Clean recommendations for decision-making
2. **execution.json**: Raw data for programmatic analysis
3. **interactions.md**: Agent reasoning chains for validation
4. **debug.txt**: Complete troubleshooting information

### Transparency Requirements
- Need to trace every recommendation back to agent reasoning
- Validate that agents aren't converging on obvious solutions
- Identify which factors drive scores (for future profile refinement)
- Debug failed runs without losing partial data

### DataCollector Class Design
```python
class DataCollector:
    # execution_log: Step-by-step process tracking
    # agent_outputs: Individual agent results
    # task_results: Task completion data  
    # agent_conversations: Inter-agent communication
    # errors: Failure modes and recovery
    # metadata: Timing, token usage, configuration
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration and Customization

### Key Adjustable Parameters

**Problem Statement** (`PROBLEM_STATEMENT`):
- Modify this to simulate different technical problems
- Keep specific constraints and success criteria

**Developer Profile** (`DEVELOPER_PROFILE`):
- Add/remove preference dimensions
- Adjust weights based on personal priorities
- Use negative values for strong dislikes

**Agent Configuration**:
```python
# Creativity vs Cost trade-off
temperature=0.7    # Higher = more creative, more tokens
temperature=0.3    # Lower = consistent, cheaper

# Model selection for different tasks
gemini_pro   # Creative generation, complex reasoning
gemini_flash # Classification, scoring, simple extraction
```

**Solution Generation Scope**:
```python
# Modify generation task to explore specific paradigms:
# - File watching approaches
# - UI/UX alternatives  
# - Deployment strategies
# - Integration patterns
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install crewai langchain-google-genai python-dotenv

# 2. Set API key
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"

# 3. Run simulation
python enhanced_gemini_simulator.py
```

### Expected Output Timeline
- **Setup**: 30 seconds
- **Generation**: 2-3 minutes (SolutionArchitect)
- **Critique**: 3-5 minutes (TechnicalCritic)  
- **Scoring**: 1-2 minutes (ProfileAlignment)
- **Total**: ~10 minutes, ~$4 cost

### Interpreting Results

**In results.md, look for:**
- Solutions scoring 4.0+ (high alignment with your profile)
- Critics flagging "unpredictable maintenance" (deal-breakers)
- Architecture patterns you hadn't considered

**In execution.json, analyze:**
- Token usage by agent (cost optimization insights)
- Agent reasoning patterns (validation of approach)
- Error patterns (simulation reliability)

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

**"No solutions generated"**
- Check GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable
- Verify Gemini API quota/billing
- Check execution.json for API errors

**"All solutions score poorly"**  
- Review DEVELOPER_PROFILE weights
- Check if problem constraints are too restrictive
- Examine agent_outputs in JSON for reasoning

**"Simulation incomplete"**
- Check debug.txt for execution trace
