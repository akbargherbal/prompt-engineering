_This appendix contains the final, production-ready algorithm for the JIT generation feature. It was not the direct output of any single simulation. Instead, it is the result of a human-led **synthesis** that combines the most powerful insights from all three separate simulation results._

- From **Simulation 2 (Naming)**, we take the most powerful simplification: use the `required_filename` from the start and **eliminate the need to modify `goal_map.json` entirely.**
- From **Simulation 3 (Idempotency)**, we take the core logic: **check if the required file already exists at the beginning of the function** to avoid redundant work.
- From **Simulation 1 (State Management)**, the "atomic rename" solution is no longer needed because the far superior solution from Simulation 2 removes the need to modify the map file, thus eliminating the original race condition.

#### **The Final, Production-Ready Algorithm**

This synthesized algorithm is simple, safe, robust, and maintainable.

```pseudocode
function handle_just_in_time_generation(goal, component_type, required_filename):
  // Example inputs:
  //   goal = "DEBUG"
  //   component_type = "protocol"
  //   required_filename = "root_cause_analysis_drilldown.txt"

  // 1. Determine the final path for the component using its correct name.
  component_path = "components/{component_type}s/{required_filename}"

  // 2. IDEMPOTENCY CHECK (radically simplified by insights from Simulation 2)
  // If the file we need already exists, our work is done. No map update is needed.
  if os.path.exists(component_path):
    print(f"INFO: Component '{required_filename}' already exists. No action needed.")
    return component_path

  // --- If we are here, the file does NOT exist. Proceed with generation. ---

  print(f"INFO: The required {component_type} '{required_filename}' was not found.")
  print(f"INFO: We will now generate this component.")

  // 3. Get the conceptual definition from the user.
  user_description = ask_user(f"Please provide a one-line description for the purpose of the '{required_filename}' component:")

  if user_description is empty:
    print("WARNING: No description provided. Aborting component generation.")
    return None

  // 4. Generate the component snippet via the LLM API.
  snippet_content = call_llm_api(user_description)

  if snippet_content is None:
    print("WARNING: LLM API call failed. Aborting component generation.")
    return None

  // 5. Write the component file to its final, correct path.
  // We no longer need the complex atomic rename for the map, as the map is not being touched.
  // A simple try/except for this single file-write operation is sufficient.
  try:
    save_file(component_path, snippet_content)
    print(f"SUCCESS: New component saved to '{component_path}'.")
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"CRITICAL: Failed to write component file. Aborting. Error: {e}")
    return None

  // 6. Return the path to the newly created and correctly named component.
  return component_path
```
