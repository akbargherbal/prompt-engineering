# Feature Implementation Request

## Context
You are working with a Python codebase for an XML Directory Processor. The project has a comprehensive test suite organized into critical, important, integration, and validation test categories. All existing functionality must remain intact and all tests must continue to pass.

## Current Codebase
[Attach the complete current `xml_directory_processor.py` file]

## Feature Request
I want to implement the feature described in `docs/ideas/{FEATURE_SPEC_FILE}`.

## Requirements
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality must work exactly as before
2. **Test Compatibility**: All existing tests must pass without modification
3. **Code Quality**: Maintain the same coding standards and error handling patterns
4. **Cross-Platform**: Ensure Windows compatibility while maintaining cross-platform support
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Implement proper fallback mechanisms for any new functionality

## Expected Response Format

### If Code Changes Are Required:
Provide the complete, updated `xml_directory_processor.py` file with:
- Clear comments marking what was changed and why
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Maintained backward compatibility
- All existing imports and functionality preserved

### If No Code Changes Are Required:
Explain why no changes are needed and provide step-by-step instructions for:
- Environment variable setup (if applicable)
- Configuration file changes (if applicable)  
- Command-line usage modifications (if applicable)
- Any other setup requirements

### In Both Cases, Also Provide:
1. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and how it's mitigated
2. **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the feature works without breaking existing functionality
3. **Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if issues arise
4. **Usage Examples**: Command-line examples showing the new feature in action

## Success Criteria
- Feature works as specified in the documentation
- All existing tests pass (`python quick_test_runner.py` should show all green)
- No regression in existing functionality
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- Clear user feedback for any configuration requirements

## Quality Standards
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use the same error handling approach (logging + graceful degradation)
- Maintain the same level of documentation and comments
- Ensure Windows path handling remains robust
- Preserve all existing command-line arguments and their behavior

---

**Implementation Note**: Focus on minimal, surgical changes that add the new functionality without disrupting the existing, well-tested codebase. When in doubt, prefer configuration-based solutions over code modifications.
