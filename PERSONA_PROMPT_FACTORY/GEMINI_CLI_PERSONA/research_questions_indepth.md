# Definitive Research Questions for Gemini CLI Integration Analysis

## **RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:**
Conduct comprehensive codebase analysis to provide definitive answers about programmatic interaction capabilities with the Gemini CLI tool for building file-based bridge integrations.

---

## **PHASE 1: REPOSITORY STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS**

### **Q1.1: Core Implementation Discovery**
- What is the primary entry point file (likely `src/index.ts` or `bin/gemini.js`) and what runtime environment does it establish?
- Which specific Node.js libraries are used for terminal interaction (inquirer, readline, blessed, ink, etc.)?
- What TypeScript/JavaScript classes or modules handle the core CLI loop and user interaction?

### **Q1.2: Process Architecture Mapping**
- How does the main process spawn and manage subprocesses for external tool execution?
- What signal handlers are registered for graceful shutdown and cleanup?
- Are there any daemon or background service components that persist beyond CLI execution?

---

## **PHASE 2: I/O STREAM BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION**

### **Q2.1: Interactive Mode I/O Analysis**
- In the main CLI loop implementation, does the tool read from `process.stdin` directly or through a library wrapper?
- Which specific terminal control library methods are called (e.g., `readline.createInterface()`, `inquirer.prompt()`, etc.)?
- Are there any command-line flags or environment variables that modify I/O handling behavior?

### **Q2.2: Non-Interactive Mode State Investigation** 
- In the `-p`/`--prompt` flag implementation, is there any mechanism for passing conversation context between invocations?
- Does the tool write session data to temporary files, environment variables, or other persistent storage?
- What happens to the process after a non-interactive prompt is completed?

### **Q2.3: Standard Stream Redirection Testing**
- When stdin/stdout are redirected (pipes, file redirection), does the tool detect this programmatically?
- Are there specific code paths that handle TTY vs non-TTY environments differently?
- What output goes to stdout vs stderr in both interactive and non-interactive modes?

---

## **PHASE 3: NETWORK PROTOCOL & IDE INTEGRATION ANALYSIS**

### **Q3.1: Environment Variable Investigation**
- Search the codebase for references to `GEMINI_CLI_IDE_SERVER_PORT` or similar environment variables
- What network server or client code is activated when this environment variable is set?
- Are there WebSocket, HTTP server, or other network protocol implementations?

### **Q3.2: Protocol Implementation Discovery**
- What message formats, serialization methods (JSON, protobuf, etc.) are used for network communication?
- Are there handshake, authentication, or connection lifecycle management procedures?
- Does the network protocol support bidirectional communication or is it request/response only?

### **Q3.3: IDE Integration Stability Assessment**
- Are the network protocol interfaces marked as experimental, internal, or public API?
- What error handling and reconnection logic exists in the network communication code?
- Are there version compatibility checks or protocol negotiation mechanisms?

---

## **PHASE 4: ALTERNATIVE IPC MECHANISM DISCOVERY**

### **Q4.1: IPC Implementation Search**
- Are there any named pipe, Unix socket, or file-based communication implementations?
- Does the tool create any temporary files, lock files, or shared memory segments?
- Are there any local HTTP server endpoints or REST API implementations?

### **Q4.2: Extension/Plugin Architecture Analysis**
- How are MCP servers discovered, connected to, and communicated with?
- Are there hooks or event systems that third-party tools could integrate with?
- What configuration mechanisms exist for external tool registration?

---

## **PHASE 5: SESSION STATE & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**

### **Q5.1: Memory Management Investigation**
- How is conversation history stored and managed in memory during a session?
- What data structures maintain context across multiple user prompts?
- Are there size limits, cleanup procedures, or garbage collection mechanisms for session data?

### **Q5.2: Persistence Mechanism Analysis**
- Does the tool save conversation history to disk, cache, or other persistent storage?
- Are there session recovery mechanisms if the process crashes or is terminated?
- Can session state be exported, imported, or transferred between processes?

---

## **PHASE 6: PROGRAMMATIC INTEGRATION FEASIBILITY**

### **Q6.1: Process Control Compatibility**
- How does the tool handle SIGTERM, SIGKILL, and other process management signals?
- Can the interactive session be cleanly paused, resumed, or restarted programmatically?
- What happens when stdin is closed or redirected while in interactive mode?

### **Q6.2: File-Based Bridge Viability Assessment**
- Based on I/O analysis, can prompts be reliably injected via stdin manipulation?
- Can responses be captured via stdout redirection without losing formatting or functionality?
- Are there timing considerations, race conditions, or synchronization requirements?

### **Q6.3: Alternative Architecture Recommendations**
- Based on codebase analysis, what is the most reliable approach for persistent, stateful integration?
- Are there existing patterns in the code that suggest supported integration methods?
- What modifications to the proposed file-based bridge architecture would improve reliability?

## **EXPECTED RESEARCH DELIVERABLES:**

For each question group, provide:
1. **Specific code references** (files, functions, line numbers)
2. **Actual implementation details** (not documentation summaries)
3. **Compatibility assessment** for the proposed file-based bridge approach
4. **Alternative solution recommendations** based on discovered capabilities
5. **Risk factors and limitations** identified through code analysis

This research framework will provide the definitive technical foundation needed to answer the original integration feasibility questions with complete accuracy.
