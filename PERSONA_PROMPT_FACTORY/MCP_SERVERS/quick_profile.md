### **`[CURRENT_PROJECTS_OR_GOALS]`**

I am currently developing interactive educational web applications using Python (Django and FastAPI) paired with modern frontend tools like HTMX and Alpine.js. My focus is on building robust, well-tested systems, creating automated data-processing pipelines, and deploying scalable applications on cloud platforms like Google Cloud Run. I am also exploring the integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated workflows.
