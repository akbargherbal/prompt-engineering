# Deep Research Prompt: Optimizing LLM-Powered Programming Education in the IDE-Native Era

## Research Directive

**Primary Question**: How can we achieve near-zero friction in LLM-powered programming education by leveraging IDE-native agents, large context models, and optimized learning workflows?

**Research Scope**: Investigate cutting-edge implementations, configurations, and methodologies that eliminate manual context management and create seamless learning experiences within development environments.

## Context & Background

### Previous Research Foundation
A comprehensive 2024-2025 analysis identified three paradigm shifts in LLM programming education:
