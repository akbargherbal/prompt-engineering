### **User Inputs**

**1. Existing Codebase:**

```
See the attachments.
```

**2. Session Goal:**

```
This is Session ZERO.
I have a basic static mockup that I’d like to evaluate as a potential MVP for release 0.1.0. I noticed we don't have ways to paste Gemini API key; nor a way to choose which Google Model (Pro or Flash).

My objective for this Vibe Coding Session is to generate additional static mockups for future releases—such as 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and 0.4.0.

Your job is to interview me and elicit answers to identify the requirements we should allocate for each future release.

We might also draft a document outlining the features we plan to include in each release, so we have a clear vision for the future.
