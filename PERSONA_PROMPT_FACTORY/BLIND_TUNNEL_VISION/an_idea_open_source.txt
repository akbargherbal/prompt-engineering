If GitHub were the Library of Congress—
a vast archive containing works from every discipline and language—
then GitHub would be the same, but for code:
a repository of countless apps, spanning fields and frameworks, written in languages some of us barely know.
Imagine the average visitor wandering through this library.
They might stumble upon a manuscript written twelve centuries ago,
debating theological polemics between Islamic schools of Hadith—
a text dense with context, terminology, and history they can only partially grasp.
Isn’t that what it feels like for the average programmer
browsing open-source projects?
Reading code they partly understand,
in disciplines they only vaguely recognize,
with histories they know nothing about?
