#### **Phase 1: Foundation Analysis**
```
1. Examine OLD_PAPER_TO_BE_REWRITTEN/
   - white_paper.md → Document original methodology baseline
   - all_personas_1_to_5.md → Analyze deprecated persona structures  
   - TEMPLATE_PDP.md → Understand original template approach

2. Create Baseline Understanding
   - Map original workflow limitations
   - Identify deprecated concepts and approaches
