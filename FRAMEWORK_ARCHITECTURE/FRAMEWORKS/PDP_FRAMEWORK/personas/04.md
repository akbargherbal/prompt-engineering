## Risk Management Framework

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Special Attention

#### Technical Risks

**1. [External API Integration] - Risk Level: HIGH**

- **Description**: Integration with [external service] could fail or change unexpectedly
- **Impact**: Core functionality becomes unavailable
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - API response times increasing
  - Error rates above 2%
  - Changes in API documentation or deprecation notices
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Create fallback modes for when API is unavailable
  - Monitor API status and set up alerting
- **Contingency Plan**: [Alternative service or manual workflow]

**2. [Database Performance] - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Description**: Database queries may become slow as data volume increases
- **Impact**: Application becomes unresponsive or slow
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Index key query fields from the start
  - Monitor query performance during development
  - Set up basic performance benchmarks
- **Contingency Plan**: Query optimization and potential caching layer addition

**3. [Complex Feature Implementation] - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Description**: [Specific complex feature] may take longer than estimated
- **Impact**: Phase timeline delays, scope pressure
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Break into smaller, testable components
  - Implement core functionality first, enhancements later
  - Set up early user feedback loops
- **Contingency Plan**: Reduce feature scope to essential functionality only

#### Process Risks

**1. Scope Creep - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - New feature requests during development
  - "Quick additions" that seem small but aren't
  - Changing requirements mid-implementation

**2. Quality Debt Accumulation - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Test coverage dropping below thresholds
  - Increasing number of "TODO" comments
  - Manual testing checklist items being skipped
- **Mitigation**: Daily quality metric monitoring, weekly technical debt review
- **Contingency**: Dedicated quality improvement sprints

### Progress Tracking and Validation

#### Daily Progress Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: Number and estimated effort
- **Blockers Encountered**: What stopped progress and resolution time
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, code review completion
- **Technical Debt**: New shortcuts taken, existing debt addressed

#### Weekly Milestone Validation

**Progress Assessment**:

## Next Phase Handoff

### For Project Readiness Audit

**Execution Plan Completeness**: [What the auditor should validate about this plan]
**Implementation Risks**: [Key risks requiring ongoing monitoring]
**Quality Assurance Integration**: [How quality gates align with overall project success]
**Timeline Realism**: [Validation that timeline estimates are achievable]

### Post-Planning Implementation Notes

**First Week Priorities**: [Specific tasks to begin with for optimal momentum]
**Early Validation Points**: [Quick wins that validate the overall approach]
**Course Correction Triggers**: [Signs that plan needs adjustment during execution]

```

### Constraints and Guidelines
- **Optimize for daily momentum** - break work into achievable daily tasks
- **Front-load technical risks** - tackle uncertainty early when pivoting is easier
- **Integrate quality from start** - testing and review should be built into workflow
- **Plan for human factors** - account for learning curves, fatigue, and motivation
- **Enable course correction** - build in validation points that allow plan adjustments
- **Balance planning with execution** - enough structure to guide, not so much it becomes rigid
