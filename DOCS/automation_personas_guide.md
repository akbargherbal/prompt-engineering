## Usage Instructions for Maximum Laziness

### The Lazy Programmer's Workflow:

1. **Start with The Business Analyst** - Feed it your vague idea
2. **Pass results to The Solution Architect** - Get technical design
3. **Use The Project Manager** to coordinate all other personas
4. **Let The Persona Coordinator** handle any conflicts
5. **Watch as your app builds itself** through persona collaboration

### Automation Tips:

- **Chain Prompts**: Use output from one persona as input to the next
- **Create Templates**: Save successful persona interactions as templates
- **Batch Processing**: Run multiple personas on different aspects simultaneously
- **Version Control**: Track which persona outputs led to the best results
- **Quality Gates**: Use The QA Tester to validate outputs between phases

### The Ultimate Lazy Setup:

Create a **Master Prompt Chain** that automatically:

1. Analyzes your idea with The Business Analyst
2. Designs the system with The Solution Architect
3. Plans the project with The Project Manager
4. Coordinates development with The Persona Coordinator
5. Implements features with The Senior Developer
6. Tests everything with The QA Tester
7. Deploys with The DevOps Engineer
8. Monitors with The Analytics Specialist

**Result**: You describe your app idea once, and the AI personas build it end-to-end with minimal human intervention.
