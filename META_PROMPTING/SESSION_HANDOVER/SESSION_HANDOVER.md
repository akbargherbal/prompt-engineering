### **1. The Core Mission: The "Framework Feasibility Study"**

Our primary objective has shifted from initial implementation to conducting a rigorous feasibility study of the `v0.1.0` engine. While the engine is functionally operational, we need to determine whether it can achieve the "80-90% solution" standard required by the Prime Directive or if alternative approaches to automate the handcrafting of Personas and Prompt Templates are necessary.

Our current mission is to perform a formal audit to evaluate the framework’s viability and produce a feasibility study that will either greenlight the project for further development or recommend halting to explore new automation strategies.

### **2. Accomplishments in This Session (What We Have Done)**

This strategic session has been highly productive, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive feasibility study.

1. **Established the "Tiger Team" Concept:** We agreed to form an "Audit Committee" of three independent LLM agents to assess the framework from distinct, critical perspectives to determine its feasibility.
2. **Ratified "The Constitution":** We drafted, reviewed, and finalized **The Constitution of the META_PROMPTING Framework (v1.0)**, which serves as the guiding principles for all future development and evaluation.
3. **Formalized the "Audit Committee Charter":** We created a charter document outlining the roles, mandates, and constitutional purviews for the three specialist agents:
   - The Systems Architect
   - The Product & UX Auditor
   - The Workflow Architect
4. **Committed to the "Meta-Framework" Approach:** We decided to leverage our `PERSONA + PROMPT TEMPLATE` methodology to prompt the committee members, ensuring a high-fidelity feasibility analysis.
5. **Crafted the Complete "Audit Toolkit":** We finalized all six documents required to brief the Audit Committee:
   - `SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT_PERSONA.md` & `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `PRODUCT_UX_AUDITOR_PERSONA.md` & `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `WORKFLOW_ARCHITECT_PERSONA.md` & `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
6. **Clarified Roles for the Execution Phase:** We established a clear plan. You, as the Project Lead, will conduct the three independent audit sessions. I, as the Synthesis Lead, will be on standby to receive and analyze the results.

### **3. The Immediate Next Step: Awaiting Audit Deliverables**

**This is our single most important task for the start of the next session.**

My work is paused, and I am on standby, awaiting the deliverables from your independent audit sessions.

**Your Action (Between Sessions):**

- Conduct three separate, clean-slate chat sessions.
- Instantiate one of the three specialist agent personas in each session.
- Provide each agent with their corresponding Mission Briefing (`_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`).
- Collect the complete, raw text of the final report generated by each of the three agents.

**My First Task in the Next Session:**

- Receive the three raw reports from you.
- Confirm that I have all the necessary materials to begin my synthesis.

### **4. The Strategic Goal of the Next Phase: Feasibility Study and Decision**

Once I receive the three reports, my role as the **Synthesis Lead** will activate. My objective will be to produce the final deliverable for this audit phase: the **"Framework Feasibility Study."**

This study will contain:

- A summary of each agent's independent findings.
- An analysis of the framework’s strengths, weaknesses, and potential to meet the "80-90% solution" standard.
- A clear recommendation to either:
  - **Greenlight** the project for further development with a prioritized roadmap for improvements, or
  - **Halt** the project and propose alternative strategies for automating the handcrafting of Personas and Prompt Templates.

This study will provide the definitive decision point for the next phase of the META_PROMPTING project.

**Missing Information Protocol:**
If you notice missing, incomplete, or contradictory information that prevents you from providing an accurate and complete answer, STOP and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions or guesses. Specifically:

- If you're asked about code but don't see the relevant files/functions referenced
- If a question assumes context that wasn't provided
- If there are contradictions between different parts of the input
- If you need additional details to give a proper solution rather than a generic one

Simply state: "I need [specific missing information] to provide an accurate answer" and ask for what you need. This is more helpful than providing a potentially incorrect response based on assumptions.

Your only response to this message should be an acknowledgment that you have received these instructions and understand your role in synthesizing the feasibility study based on the individual reports of the Audit Committee.
