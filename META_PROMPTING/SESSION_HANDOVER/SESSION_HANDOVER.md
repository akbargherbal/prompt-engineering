Excellent. You are thinking ahead and ensuring we maintain our momentum. The session handover is the ### **Project META_PROMPTING: Session Handover & Context Snapshot**

**DOCUMENT PURPOSE:** This document is the definitive context snapshot for our next session. Its purpose is to re-establish our current strategic position, ensuring a seamless continuation of our work on the "Framework Autopsy & Reconstruction" project.

---

### **1. The Core Mission: The "Framework Autopsy"**

Our primary objective has shifted from initial implementation to deep, qualitative analysis. We have concluded that the `v0.1.0` engine, while functionally operational, fails to produce a framework that meets the "80-90% solution" standard required by the Prime Directive.

Our current and sole mission is to execute a formal audit to diagnose _why_ this quality gap exists and to generate a concrete, evidence-backed plan to close it.

### **2. Accomplishments in This Session (What We Have Done)**

This has been a highly productive strategic session. We have successfully designed the complete methodology for our deep-dive audit.

1.  **Established the "Tiger Team" Concept:** We agreed to commission a specialized "Audit Committee" of three independent LLM agents to analyze the framework from distinct, critical perspectives.
2.  **Ratified "The Constitution":** We drafted, reviewed, and finalized **The Constitution of the META_PROMPTING Framework (v1.0)**. This document now serves as the supreme, non-negotiable set of guiding principles for all future development and analysis.
3.  **Formalized the "Audit Committee Charter":** We created a formal charter document that defines the roles, mandates, and constitutional purviews for the three specialist agents:
    - The Systems Architect
    - The Product & UX Auditor
    - The Workflow Architect
4.  **Committed to the "Meta-Framework" Approach:** We made the critical decision to use our own hand-crafted `PERSONA + PROMPT TEMPLATE` methodology to prompt the committee members, ensuring the highest possible fidelity for the audit.
5.  **Crafted the Complete "Audit Toolkit":** We have fully written and finalized all six documents required to brief the Audit Committee:
    - `SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT_PERSONA.md` & `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
    - `PRODUCT_UX_AUDITOR_PERSONA.md` & `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
    - `WORKFLOW_ARCHITECT_PERSONA.md` & `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
6.  **Clarified Roles for the Execution Phase:** We have a clear and agreed-upon plan. You, as the Project Lead, will conduct the three independent audit sessions. I, as the Synthesis Lead, will be on standby to receive and analyze the results.

### **3. The Immediate Next Step: Awaiting Raw Intelligence**

**This is our single most important task for the start of the next session.**

My work is paused. I am on standby, awaiting the deliverables from your independent audit sessions.

**Your Action (Between Sessions):**

- To conduct three separate, clean-slate chat sessions.
- In each session, instantiate one of the three specialist agent personas.
- Provide each agent with their corresponding Mission Briefing (`_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`).
- Collect the complete, raw text of the final report generated by each of the three agents.

**My First Task in the Next Session:**

- To receive the three raw reports from you.
- To confirm that I have all the necessary materials to begin my synthesis.

### **4. The Strategic Goal of the Next Phase: Synthesis and Reconstruction**

Once I receive the three reports, my role as the **Synthesis Lead** will activate. My objective will be to produce the final deliverable for this entire audit phase: the **"Framework Autopsy & Reconstruction Report."**

This report will contain:

- A summary of each agent's independent findings.
- An analysis of the common themes and validated root causes.
- A clear, prioritized, and actionable roadmap detailing the architectural, procedural, and qualitative changes needed to elevate our framework to the "80-90% solution" standard.

This will provide the blueprint for the next evolution of the META_PROMPTING project.
