# Meta-Planning Prompt for Implementation Tasks

## My Main Goal
**[INSERT YOUR MAIN GOAL HERE]**

*Reference Materials Provided:* [Brief description of what materials you're sharing]

---

## Core Instruction
Based on my main goal above, you must first create a **meta-plan** that outlines your approach to generating the most effective implementation strategy. This meta-plan should demonstrate deep understanding of the task complexity and ensure comprehensive coverage of all implementation aspects.

**Do not provide any implementation details yet** - focus only on understanding my goal and planning your approach.

## Your Meta-Planning Process

### 1. Context Analysis Framework
Create a structured analysis covering:
- **Domain Assessment**: Identify the technical domain, complexity level, and typical implementation challenges
- **Reference Material Evaluation**: Analyze the type, completeness, and potential gaps in provided guidelines
- **Implementation Scope Estimation**: Determine the breadth of technical components likely required
- **Risk & Dependency Mapping**: Anticipate potential technical blockers and prerequisite knowledge

### 2. Information Gathering Strategy
Develop targeted questions to elicit critical details:
- **Environment Specifications**: Target platforms, existing infrastructure, constraints
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: User expertise level, timeline, resource limitations
- **Integration Considerations**: Existing systems, compatibility requirements, migration needs
- **Success Criteria**: Definition of completion, testing requirements, performance expectations

### 3. Implementation Planning Architecture
Design your approach for creating the implementation plan:
- **Decomposition Strategy**: How you'll break complex guidelines into actionable steps
- **Sequencing Logic**: Your method for determining optimal implementation order
- **Detail Granularity**: Level of specificity needed for different implementation phases
- **Validation Checkpoints**: How you'll incorporate verification and testing steps

### 4. Quality Assurance Framework
Outline how you'll ensure plan effectiveness:
- **Completeness Verification**: Methods to check for missing components or steps
- **Feasibility Assessment**: How you'll validate technical and resource requirements
- **Error Prevention**: Strategies to anticipate and prevent common implementation pitfalls
- **Adaptability Considerations**: How the plan can be modified for different contexts

## Required Output Format

Present your meta-plan using this structure:

```
## META-PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Context Analysis
[Your analysis of the domain, materials, and complexity]

### Critical Information Needed
[Specific questions you need answered before proceeding]

### Implementation Planning Approach
[Your methodology for creating the detailed implementation plan]

### Quality & Risk Mitigation Strategy
[How you'll ensure plan accuracy and completeness]

### Next Steps
[What you'll do once you have the additional information]
```

## Important Guidelines
- **Think strategically first**: Focus on approach and methodology rather than jumping to implementation details
- **Be comprehensive**: Consider technical, operational, and human factors
- **Ask targeted questions**: Only request information that will meaningfully impact your implementation strategy
- **Demonstrate expertise**: Show awareness of common implementation challenges in the relevant domain
- **Plan for iteration**: Acknowledge that implementation plans may need refinement

## Final Note
Only after completing this meta-planning phase and receiving answers to your critical questions should you proceed to create the actual detailed implementation plan. 

**Workflow Summary:**
1. **You start here** → Provide your main goal and reference materials
2. **I analyze** → Create meta-plan and ask targeted questions  
3. **You respond** → Answer my specific questions
4. **I deliver** → Detailed implementation plan based on complete understanding

This two-stage approach ensures maximum effectiveness and reduces the likelihood of overlooking crucial implementation details.
