### **1. Flaw Analysis**

The proposed Just-in-Time (JIT) generation algorithm introduces a significant and insidious form of technical debt: **conceptual inconsistency**. It fundamentally violates the project's own design philosophy of creating a clean, human-readable, and maintainable system.

The core flaw lies in the decision to generate a _new, derivative filename_ (`autogen_protocol_for_diagnose_root_cause.txt`) and then mutate the `goal_map.json` to point to it. This creates a cascade of negative downstream consequences:

- **Destruction of the "Source of Truth":** The `goal_map.json` is designed to be the human-readable "brain" of the system. It represents the architect's intent. The proposed algorithm corrupts this source of truth, transforming it from a declarative blueprint into a mutable state log. The user's mental model of the system, based on the original `goal_map.json`, is immediately invalidated.

- **Increased Cognitive Load:** A developer looking at the modified `goal_map.json` will see a mapping from `DIAGNOSE_ROOT_CAUSE` to `autogen_protocol_for_diagnose_root_cause.txt`. They have no way of knowing this was originally intended to be `root_cause_analysis_drilldown.txt`. This disconnect forces the developer to cross-reference files and mentally translate between the "intended" name and the "actual" name, increasing the cognitive load required to understand and maintain the system.

- **Violation of the "Artisan Engineer" Principle:** The target user is an "Artisan Engineer" who values control and clarity. The proposed algorithm creates a "Magic Black Box" behavior where the system alters its own core configuration without a clear, intuitive reason. This erodes trust and violates the principle that the user should be the master of the system.

- **Creation of Orphaned Concepts:** Over time, this process would litter the `components/` directory with inconsistently named `autogen_*.txt` files. The original, more descriptive names from the `goal_map.json` would exist only as historical artifacts in version control, creating a confusing and brittle component library.

In short, the proposed algorithm prioritizes a shortsighted, programmatic convenience at the expense of long-term conceptual integrity. It treats the `goal_map.json` as a mutable variable instead of the stable constitution it is meant to be.

### **2. Proposed Solution**

The superior strategy is to treat the JIT generation process as a **"self-healing" mechanism for the component library, not a mutation of the core configuration.** The `goal_map.json` file must be treated as immutable at runtime.

The guiding principle is simple: **The system should create the exact file that `goal_map.json` expects.**

When the orchestrator determines that the required file—for instance, `components/protocols/root_cause_analysis_drilldown.txt`—is missing, its sole objective should be to create _that specific file_ at _that specific path_.

This approach has several profound benefits:

- **Maintains Conceptual Integrity:** The filename in `goal_map.json` is always the filename on the disk. The configuration remains the single, stable, human-readable source of truth.
- **Zero Cognitive Load:** The system behaves exactly as the user would expect. There is no magic, no indirection, and no need for mental translation.
- **Preserves the Blueprint:** `goal_map.json` remains a clean, declarative blueprint of the ideal framework structure. It can be read, understood, and modified by a human without needing to account for programmatic side effects.
- **Fulfills the Design Philosophy:** This solution is simple, elegant, and respects the "Artisan Engineer" by providing a transparent and predictable "self-healing" capability without violating the system's core architecture.

The JIT generation is not a feature for creating _new_ logic; it is a feature for fulfilling the _pre-existing logic_ defined in the configuration map.

### **3. Revised Algorithm**

The following revised pseudocode implements the superior strategy, ensuring the system is robust, maintainable, and conceptually consistent.

```pseudocode
function handle_just_in_time_generation(goal, component_type, required_filename):
  // This function is called when os.path.exists() for required_filename returns False.
  // Example inputs:
  //   goal = "DIAGNOSE_ROOT_CAUSE"
  //   component_type = "protocol"
  //   required_filename = "root_cause_analysis_drilldown.txt"

  print(f"INFO: The required {component_type} '{required_filename}' was not found.")
  print(f"INFO: We will now generate this component to self-heal the library.")

  // 1. Get the conceptual definition from the user, using the correct filename for context.
  user_description = ask_user(f"Please provide a one-line description for the purpose of the '{required_filename}' component:")

  // 2. Generate the component snippet via the LLM API.
  snippet_content = call_llm_api(user_description)

  // 3. THE CORRECT STATE CHANGE
  // The system creates the exact file the goal_map.json expects.
  // The goal_map.json file is NEVER modified.

  // Step 3a: Write the new component file to the library using its correct, intended name.
  new_component_path = "components/{component_type}s/{required_filename}"
  save_file(new_component_path, snippet_content)
  print(f"SUCCESS: New component saved to '{new_component_path}'.")
  print("INFO: The component library is now synchronized with goal_map.json.")

  // 4. Return the path to the newly created component.
  return new_component_path
```
