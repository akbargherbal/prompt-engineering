### **Project META_PROMPTING: Session Handover & Context Snapshot**

**DOCUMENT PURPOSE:** This document is the definitive context snapshot for the META_PROMPTING project. Its purpose is to re-establish the full project state for the AI assistant in our next session, ensuring a seamless continuation of our work.

### **1. The Core Mission: The "Prime Directive" is Now Codified**

The single most important accomplishment of this session was to move beyond abstract goals and codify the project's precise definition of success. The entire project philosophy is now explicitly documented in the new **`docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md`** file.

- **The "Why" is Clear:** Our mission is to solve the "8-Hour-to-1-Hour" problem. The framework is a success if, and only if, it can take a process that used to require a full day of manual effort and reduce it to ~1 hour of focused, high-value fine-tuning.

- **The "Who" is Defined:** We are building this for the **"Artisan Engineer"**â€”a user who values their craft and wants a powerful tool to accelerate the 80% of scaffolding work, freeing them to apply their expertise to the final 20% of artisanal polish.

This Prime Directive is now the constitution against which all future development work will be measured.

### **2. Accomplishments in This Session (What's Done)**

We have successfully completed the full strategic and architectural design phase. The blueprint is now stable, comprehensive, and ready for implementation.

1.  **FINALIZED THE GOAL ARCHITECTURE:** We evolved the `goal_map.json` from a simple list into a sophisticated, two-tiered structure that correctly balances the framework's dual purpose:

    - **`Technical & Execution`** goals for task-oriented work.
    - **`Strategic & Developmental`** goals for planning and ideation.
      The final, populated `goal_map.json` file is complete and saved.

2.  **PERFORMED A FULL "DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY" PASS:** We systematically reviewed the entire project to ensure all documents are consistent with our finalized design.

    - **Created:** `docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md`
    - **Updated:** `docs/STRATEGIC_PLAN.md` (to reflect the new wizard UI and JIT logic)
    - **Updated:** `docs/SIMULATION_BRIEFING.md` (with a superior intro and a reusable template structure)
    - **Updated:** `README.md` (with the correct roadmap and usage example)
    - **Updated:** `WHITE_PAPER.md` (with the correct workflow example)

3.  **ESTABLISHED THE "PROJECT CHARTER" CONCEPT:** We identified the value of the layman's summary ("Robotic Kitchen Assistant") and integrated it into the `SIMULATION_BRIEFING.md` to be used as a high-efficiency context capsule for any future external analysis.

4.  **DEFINED THE SIMULATION ARCHIVING PROTOCOL:** We established a clean workflow where completed simulation results are archived to a `LEGACY` folder, ensuring the active context remains pure and focused on the project's current state.

### **3. The Next Critical Task: Build the `orchestrator.py` Engine**

**This is our immediate and only priority for the next session.**

All prerequisite design, philosophy, and architectural questions have been answered. The blueprint is complete. The next step is to translate that blueprint into functional code.

**Definition of "Done" for Next Session:**
We will have a working version of the `orchestrator.py` script that successfully implements the end-to-end workflow as defined in `docs/STRATEGIC_PLAN.md`. This includes:

- Reading the nested `goal_map.json` file.
- Displaying the new, two-tiered, descriptive menu to the user.
- Handling user input to select a goal.
- Assembling the final `00_PERSONA.md` and `01_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` from the correct components.
- Implementing the "self-healing" JIT generation logic if a component is missing.
- Saving the final files to the correct output directory.

### **4. Long-Term Roadmap**

1.  **[Done]** Strategic Planning
2.  **[Done]** System Architecture & Design
3.  **[Current]** **Build the Orchestrator**
4.  **[Next]** Component Generation & Testing

---

**IMPORTANT:** When we resume, your first prompt should be to confirm that you have reviewed this handover and are ready to begin the implementation of `orchestrator.py`.
