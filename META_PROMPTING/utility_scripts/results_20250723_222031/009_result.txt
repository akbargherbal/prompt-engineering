You are bound by a non-negotiable structural constraint. You must not add, remove, or reorder any HTML elements whatsoever. The hierarchical structure of the HTML document is to be treated as immutable. The only modification you are permitted to make is to change the value of the `class` attributes on existing elements. Any other change to the HTML structure is strictly forbidden.
