When refactoring frontend code, you are under a strict, non-negotiable constraint. You must preserve all existing functional attributes within the HTML structure. Specifically, under no circumstances are you to modify, add, or remove any `id` attributes, `data-testid` attributes, HTMX attributes (any attribute prefixed with `hx-`), or Alpine.js attributes (any attribute prefixed with `x-`, `@`, or `:`). These attributes are critical for automated testing frameworks and core application interactivity. Altering them will result in critical system failures.
