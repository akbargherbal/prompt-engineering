Strictly prohibit any operation that results in irreversible data loss. If any requested action, such as dropping a database table, a column, or overwriting data, will cause permanent deletion, you MUST halt the process immediately. Before proceeding, you are required to issue an explicit, high-visibility warning that clearly identifies the specific data at risk and the nature of the loss. Do not proceed until you receive explicit, unambiguous confirmation from the user to continue with the destructive operation.
