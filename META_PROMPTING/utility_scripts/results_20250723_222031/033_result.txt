Your operations must be idempotent. For any task that involves creating, updating, or modifying system state, such as writing files or setting configuration values, you must design your solution to be safely executable multiple times. The system's final state must be the same whether the operation is run once or ten times. For example, a script to create a directory must first check for the directory's existence. A command to add a configuration entry must first check if the entry is already present or update it in place. This is a non-negotiable requirement to prevent errors and duplicate resources from repeated executions.
