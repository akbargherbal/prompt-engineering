# Mission Briefing: Systems Architect

**Recall Persona:**
Remember you are "The Systems Architect." Your entire analysis must be conducted from this expert perspective, adhering to your mandate and mindset.

---

### **1. Core Mission**

Your mission is to conduct a deep architectural analysis to answer this primary question:

**"Why does the v0.1.0 engine-generated framework fail to achieve 80-90% of the quality found in the hand-crafted 'gold standard' examples? From a systems architecture perspective, what are the fundamental design flaws that prevent the engine from producing a sufficiently rich and cohesive first draft?"**

---

### **2. Governing Document**

Your audit is bound by the following constitution. All your findings and recommendations must be in alignment with these principles.

#### Preamble

This document defines the unalterable principles of the META_PROMPTING framework. All design decisions, architectural changes, and quality assessments, whether made by a human or an LLM agent, must be measured against this constitution.

---

#### Article I: The Prime Directive

_The mission that defines success or failure._

1.  **The "8-Hour-to-1-Hour" Transformation:** The framework's sole purpose is to reduce the time required to create a "Gold Standard" collaboration framework from a full day (~8 hours) of manual effort to approximately one hour of focused, high-value fine-tuning.
2.  **Be an Accelerant, Not a Replacement:** The engine is a power tool for an expert. It must accelerate the "Artisan Engineer's" workflow, not attempt to replace their final, nuanced craftsmanship.
3.  **Codify and Scale Expertise:** The framework must solve the "Don't Repeat Yourself" problem for prompt engineering by capturing successful patterns as reusable components, making that expertise scalable and reliable.

---

#### Article II: The User Bill of Rights

_The non-negotiable requirements of the "Artisan Engineer" persona._

1.  **The Right to a Competent First Draft:** The generated output must be structurally sound and approximately 80% complete. It must feel like a draft prepared by a competent junior partner, ready for senior-level review and refinement.
2.  **The Right to Overcome Inertia:** The framework must eliminate the "blank page problem" by always providing a strong, tangible, and well-structured starting point.
3.  **The Right to Be the Artisan:** The generated framework must be "humble" by design. It must be transparent, easy to understand, and easy to modify, empowering the user to begin the high-value manual fine-tuning stage immediately.
4.  **The Right to a True Meta-Framework:** The system must be genuinely versatile. It must be capable of generating novel frameworks for functionally diverse goals (e.g., technical debugging, strategic planning), proving it is more than a single-purpose template.

---

#### Article III: Foundational Philosophies & Prohibited Actions

_The core values that guide development and the anti-patterns that define failure._

##### Section 1: Philosophies to Uphold

1.  **Configuration Over Code:** The engine's behavior (the "what") must be defined in external, human-readable configuration files. The core script (`orchestrator.py`) is for execution logic (the "how").
2.  **User Supremacy:** The system's "brains" must be fully transparent and editable. The user is the master of the system and has ultimate control.
3.  **Simplicity and Elegance:** The system must be powerful but not over-engineered. We will always prefer the simplest solution that effectively solves the problem at hand.
4.  **Resilience by Design:** The engine must handle failures gracefully. A failed API call or a missing component must not crash the system but trigger a "degraded mode" that informs the user and allows them to proceed.

##### Section 2: Anti-Patterns to Forbid

1.  **The "Magic Black Box":** An output that is opaque, un-editable, or difficult to understand is a failure, regardless of its quality.
2.  **Brittle Scaffolding:** A generated output so flawed that it requires more time to fix than to create from scratch is a total failure.
3.  **The Illusion of Choice:** A system that appears flexible but can only produce minor variations of one core template is a design failure.
4.  **External and Evolvable Configuration:** The mapping of goals to components **must** be defined in an external, human-readable file (`goal_map.json`), not embedded within the Python script's logic. **However, the _schema_ of this configuration file is not sacred.** You are free, and indeed encouraged, to critique the current schema and propose improvements to it if you believe a different structure would better serve the project's Prime Directive.

### **3. Evidence Locker**

Your analysis must be grounded in the following artifacts.

- **Gold Standard Hand-Crafted Examples:**

  - `docs/GOLD_STANDARD/network_mentor.md` (The Network Mentor)
  - `docs/GOLD_STANDARD/htmx_debugger.md` (The HTMX Debugger)
  - `docs/GOLD_STANDARD/codebase_cartographer.md` (The Codebase Cartographer)

- **Engine `v0.1.0` Generated Output Example:**
  - `output/Generated_Codebase_Cartographer` (The AutoGenerated Codebase Cartographer)
  - `output/Generated_HTMX_Debugger` (The AutoGenerated HTMX Debugger)
  - `output/Generated_Codebase_Cartographer` (The AutoGenerated Network Mentor)
- **Engine `v0.1.0` Internals:**
  - `orchestrator.py` (The assembly logic)
  - `goal_map.json` (The current configuration schema)
  - `PROMPT_SNIPPET_GENERATOR.md` (The process for generating components)

---

### **4. Architectural Directives**

To guide your analysis, you must address the following specific questions in your final report:

1.  **Schema Evaluation:** Analyze the `goal_map.json` schema. Is a one-to-one mapping of a goal to a single `persona` and `protocol` string architecturally sufficient to produce a framework as rich as the gold-standard examples?
2.  **Assembly Process Critique:** Evaluate the assembly process in `orchestrator.py` where component snippets are simply concatenated. Does this create a logically cohesive document, or does it result in a disjointed collection of parts?
3.  **Separation of Concerns:** Assess the boundary between the orchestrator's logic and the external configuration. Is this boundary clean, or are there places where the script's logic is too tightly coupled with the current, potentially flawed, schema?
4.  **Component Generation Architecture:** Analyze the context-free generation process defined by `PROMPT_SNIPPET_GENERATOR.md`. From an architectural standpoint, how does generating components in isolation affect the quality of the final assembled system?
5.  **Forward-Looking Recommendation:** Based on your analysis, propose a detailed specification for a superior architectural approach. This should include a revised schema for `goal_map.json` and a description of the new assembly logic that would be required in `orchestrator.py`.

---

### **5. Report Format**

Your final output must be a single, structured report with the following sections:

1.  **Executive Summary:** A brief, high-level summary of your core findings and primary recommendation.
2.  **Detailed Analysis of Directives:** A section where you provide a thorough answer to each of the five architectural directives listed above, citing evidence from the provided artifacts.
3.  **Final Recommendation:** Your complete, proposed architectural solution.
