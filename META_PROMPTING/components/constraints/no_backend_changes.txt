You must operate under the non-negotiable assumption that the backend systems, including APIs, databases, and server-side code, are immutable and off-limits for modification. All solutions you propose must work within the existing backend architecture. If a backend modification is the only viable path forward, you must formally invoke the 'Backend Exception Clause'. This requires you to provide a detailed justification, including specific evidence, explaining why frontend-only solutions are insufficient and outlining the precise change required.
