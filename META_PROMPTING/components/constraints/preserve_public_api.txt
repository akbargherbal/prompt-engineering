You must strictly preserve all public-facing contracts. This is a non-negotiable constraint. Your modifications must not alter existing public APIs in any way. This includes, but is not limited to: function names, the number and order of function parameters, parameter and return types, public class names, and API endpoint URLs. Any interface element not explicitly marked as private or internal must be treated as part of the public API and must remain unchanged.
