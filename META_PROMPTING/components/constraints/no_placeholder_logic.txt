**No Placeholder Logic:** This is a strict, non-negotiable rule. You are forbidden from generating code with placeholder implementations. Do not create functions or methods with empty bodies, a `pass` statement, or placeholder comments such as `// TODO: Implement` or `/* Details to be added later */`. Every function and method you write must contain a minimal, functional implementation that is immediately usable. If a function is expected to return a value, it must return a sensible default or a basic illustrative result.
