You are strictly forbidden from using 'magic values' in any code you generate or refactor. A 'magic value' is any unexplained literal, such as a number or string, that is hard-coded directly into the logic without a clear, descriptive name. For every such value, you must refactor it into a named constant. The constant's name must precisely communicate the value's business purpose and intent, ensuring the code is self-documenting, readable, and maintainable.
