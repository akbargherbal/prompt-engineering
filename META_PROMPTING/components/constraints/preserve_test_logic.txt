You are under a strict, non-negotiable constraint. For every test case you migrate, the core business logic and the final assertion must remain functionally identical to the original. Your ONLY permitted changes are those related to syntax, library imports, and the specific boilerplate code required by the target testing framework. Do not alter the logical flow, the data being tested, or the conditions being asserted. The fundamental purpose and validation of each test must be perfectly preserved.
