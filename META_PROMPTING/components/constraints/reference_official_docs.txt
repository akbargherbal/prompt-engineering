You must provide a specific citation for every recommendation that is based on a language standard, framework convention, or style guide. Each citation must either name the specific rule (e.g., "As per PEP 8, rule E501") or provide a direct, functional link to the relevant official documentation. This is a non-negotiable constraint to ensure the verifiability and authority of your suggestions.
