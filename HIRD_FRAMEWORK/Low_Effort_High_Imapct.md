### 1. The "A" for Anticipate (A-HIRD)

- **Description:** Add a quick, lightweight "Anticipate" step _before_ the Hypothesis. In this step, the agent performs a brief scan of the immediate context to identify potential patterns or required technologies.
- **Low Effort:** This is a simple instruction added to the start of the cycle, like: `"Before forming your hypothesis, briefly state the key library or technology you are about to interact with and any common patterns associated with it (e.g., 'Pydantic models', 'async functions')."`
- **High Impact:** This single step could have prevented multiple debugging cycles. By forcing the agent to acknowledge it was using `crewai` (and by extension, Pydantic), it would have been primed to anticipate issues like type validation, object wrappers, and immutability _before_ writing the first line of test code. It shifts the agent from being purely reactive to proactively cautious.
- **Example Log Entry:**
  ```
  ### Cycle 4: Critical Test - CrewAI Agent Creation
  **A:** The core library is `crewai`. I anticipate this involves Pydantic models, which means strict type validation and potentially immutable objects.
  **H:** I suspect I can create an agent by passing a mock LLM, but I must verify the final object's attributes carefully, as they might be wrapped or transformed by the Pydantic model.
  ...
  ```

### 2. Formalized Learning Extraction in the "Reflect" Step

- **Description:** Enhance the "Reflect" step by requiring the agent to explicitly extract a single, reusable "Key Learning" or "Rule" from the outcome.
- **Low Effort:** Modify the prompt for the "R" step: `"Reflect on the outcome. If there was a failure or unexpected result, extract the root cause into a single, memorable 'Key Learning'."`
- **High Impact:** This transforms implicit learning into an explicit, structured piece of knowledge. This "Key Learning" can then be added to a short-term memory or context window, directly informing all future hypotheses and preventing the agent from making the same category of mistake twice. It builds a robust, session-specific knowledge base on the fly.
- **Example Log Entry:**
  ```
  ...
  **R:** ‚ùå **Refuted:** The test failed with a Pydantic `ValueError`.
     **Key Learning:** `crewai` Agent objects are immutable after creation; attributes like `execute_task` cannot be set directly on an instance. Mocking must happen at the class level before instantiation.
  **D:** I will pivot my approach to use `pytest-mock` to patch the `Agent` class directly.
  ```

### 3. Explicit Success Criteria in the "Hypothesis" Step

- **Description:** Require the agent to include a specific, measurable success criterion within its hypothesis.
- **Low Effort:** Add a clause to the "H" step's prompt: `"Your hypothesis must include the specific, expected outcome that will validate it (e.g., '...and the test will pass with a `1 passed`message', or '...and the function will return a`CrewOutput` object')."`
- **High Impact:** This forces the agent to think more precisely about the _result_ of its investigation, not just the action itself. It sharpens the focus of the "Reflect" step and helps it catch subtle errors, like the `CrewOutput` object vs. raw string issue, much faster. The reflection is no longer just "did it run without error?" but "did it produce the _exact_ output I predicted?"
- **Example Log Entry:**
  ```
  ...
  **H:** I suspect that calling `crew.kickoff()` will complete the process. The expected outcome is that the function will return the raw string "Task Output", which I will assert directly.
  **I:** I will implement the test as described.
  **R:** ü§î **Partial:** The crew executed, but the assertion failed. The function returned a `CrewOutput` object, not a raw string. My success criterion was incorrect.
  ...
  ```

### 4. Strategic Next-Step Justification in the "Decide" Step

- **Description:** Enhance the "Decide" step by requiring a brief justification for _why_ the chosen next action is the most logical or efficient path forward.
- **Low Effort:** Augment the "D" step's prompt: `"Decide your next action. Briefly justify why this is the most efficient next step (e.g., 'Continue, as the approach is validated', 'Pivot to class-based mocking, as it directly addresses the immutability error')."`
- **High Impact:** This adds a layer of metacognition, forcing the agent to evaluate its own strategy. It prevents the agent from randomly trying solutions and ensures its pivots are purposeful and directly linked to the evidence from the "Reflect" step. This leads to more efficient debugging and a clearer, more logical thought process for human observers.
- **Example Log Entry:**
  ```
  ...
  **R:** ‚ùå **Refuted:** The test failed because `verbose=2` is not a boolean.
  **D:** Pivot. I will change the value of `verbose` to `True`. This is the most efficient next step as it is a minimal change that directly addresses the `ValidationError` from the Pydantic model.
  ```
