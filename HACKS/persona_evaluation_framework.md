# LLM Persona Quality Assessment Framework (LPQAF)

## Framework Overview
The **LLM Persona Quality Assessment Framework** is a comprehensive 100-point evaluation system designed to objectively assess and compare LLM personas for publication quality. The framework evaluates personas across six critical dimensions that directly impact user experience and prompt effectiveness.

## Scoring Interpretation

### **Score Ranges:**
- **90-100**: Exceptional quality, ready for premium publication
- **80-89**: High quality, suitable for publication with minor refinements
- **70-79**: Good quality, needs moderate improvements
- **60-69**: Fair quality, significant improvements needed
- **50-59**: Poor quality, major revision required
- **Below 50**: Unsuitable for publication

### **Publication Decision Matrix:**
- **Difference ≥ 15 points**: Clear winner, publish higher scoring persona
- **Difference 10-14 points**: Strong preference for higher scoring persona
- **Difference 5-9 points**: Moderate preference, consider hybrid approach
- **Difference < 5 points**: Nearly equivalent, use secondary criteria (audience preference, brand alignment, etc.)

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Evaluation Process:**
1. **Independent Scoring**: 2-3 evaluators score each persona independently
2. **Score Averaging**: Calculate mean scores for each dimension
3. **Discrepancy Resolution**: Discuss and resolve scores differing by >2 points
4. **Final Calculation**: Sum all dimensional scores for total score

### **Quality Assurance:**
- Use standardized evaluation rubrics for consistency
- Include domain expert in evaluation panel
- Test personas with sample prompts when possible
- Document rationale for all scores ≥7 or ≤3

### **Continuous Calibration:**
- Review scoring accuracy against user feedback post-publication
- Adjust rubrics based on performance data
- Update framework annually based on evolving best practices
